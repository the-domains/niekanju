# niekanju says "hi"

Hi, I'm niekanju. I'm an analogue photographer (yes, we still exist) meaning that I shoot with 35mm film that you might have never heard of before, or you remember using it as a child with your parents. Since digital photography came out, there have been swathes of people who got into photography (myself included) but I always felt that digital didn't have the same kind of feel that film does.

A lot of people say that if you shoot film, you can't edit it or else what's the point. I say, "Who cares?" Photography to each and every person has a very different meaning. There's no "right" way to do photography, just like there's no "right" way to eat food or speak a language. There was always something about the depth and the texture that really got me for film and I like the patience that I have with film.

Armed with a Nikon FM3a, 400 / 800 film, and a 50mm 1.4, I hope that I can bring some pleasing visuals for your enjoyment. Sometimes though, I'll add something from my mobile phone because some moments are too good to pass up. Each of my photographs will contain a little story, but whether it's the truth or made up is something you'll have to decide on your own. I would love it if you shared with your friends and shared your thoughts with me.

But really, who is niekanju? Where does niekanju come from? niekanju is a representation of me. With uncertainty to my upbringing and cultural alignment, I've been roaming the earth in search of myself really. niekanju is here to help me find me.

I hope you enjoy your viewing.
