# Crowded Solitude

Whenever I travel, I like to look at people, talk to people, and be with people, even if I don't know them. There's always a serenity to looking at people who are complete strangers, but on their side, there's an anxiety if they know you're going to take a picture of them.

One time in Seoul, South Korea, I looked down a long escalator and everyone was standing on the right hand side. No one walked, no one stood on the left. 20-30 strangers and they spent that 30 seconds in solitude. One girl stood out, however, the girl in focus, because before this shot, she actually stood on the left... but when she realized I was about to take a picture of her, she tried to disappear into the crowd.

It's interesting how people find solitude and protection in the masses. Does that speak to our tendency for conformity? I suppose that it's like camouflage (you have no idea how many times I tried to spell that word right) but it works in reverse, I find. When someone wants to try to disappear into the crowd, they could, but they also have a very limited knowledge if someone is watching them. We ourselves feel that kind of invisibility factor, but in reality, a person can really stand out if you've caught the attention of someone else.

_And my dear subject, you've caught my attention._

I hope you enjoyed your viewing.
