# Spare Change
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/705f917a-51b8-4f16-bdd0-41a342e9fdea.jpg)

I like to be a student of the world and cultures, and the best way to experience this is to travel continuously and speak to strangers. I think I'm both extroverted and introverted and so I'm lucky that I can strike up a conversation with complete strangers if I wanted to. The introvert in me seeks out times where I keep to myself, observe and learn from my surroundings. 

I was in India not too long ago and while stopped at a traffic light (or just stuck in traffic because it's horrible), I saw a little girl start to approach cars and ask for money. After a few rejections, she approached our car and started to peek inside, trying to find sight into our car from the harsh sunlight. 

This got me thinking: do I give some spare change so that she can have a great day? Or do I ignore and hope that this can _spare some change_ to the practice of begging at such a young age? As empathetic as I am, I can't even begin to start to understand the life they live to need to beg for money in the middle of the Indian summer heat enhanced by idling cars. It was a stark reminder that the lives that so many of live are far more comfortable than those who have to endure such harsh realities. 

_Maybe one day, the contrast between societies won't be so stark. _

I hope you enjoyed your viewing.
