</article><p>Sometimes when you observe people from afar, you really get to see some magical moments that to others may seem very normal or basic, but with a little bit of context (or imagination) the picture has a deeper meaning. Of course, I'm not going to be making up a story about this picture here. </p><p>I took this image again while I was in India, and again, stuck in traffic. The magical thing about this is just me wondering all the stories about this couple on the bike. Where are they going? Where are they coming from? Are they close? Brother and sister? Father and daughter? Man and wife? How long have they been stuck in traffic for? </p><p>When you start to ask these kinds of questions, you start to be able to weave an intricate story from just one image. A picture is worth a thousand words? </p><p><em>Nah, to me, a picture is worth a thousand stories. </em></p><p>I hope you enjoyed your viewing.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="17"><!-- react-empty: 18 --></div></section><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-center group-order-normal  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="19"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="20"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ls-w-50p" data-reactid="21"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="22"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="23"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a157775f6cae913f7923a3b57a414e22/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F1682082d-ea56-46ba-8142-3ea07486c857.jpg&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:69.43359375% 87.03976435935199%;" data-reactid="24"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/baaf947fc76b50f769ba1e166fa1aca6/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F1682082d-ea56-46ba-8142-3ea07486c857.jpg&amp;width=1280" style="object-position:69.43359375% 87.03976435935199%;" data-reactid="25"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/8c752057b658f483dcebb025a68adaaa/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F1682082d-ea56-46ba-8142-3ea07486c857.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:69.43359375% 87.03976435935199%;" data-reactid="26"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b5792df895aa24000a35836cef330b2d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F1682082d-ea56-46ba-8142-3ea07486c857.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:69.43359375% 87.03976435935199%;" data-reactid="27"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="2048" data-height="1358" data-ratio="1.508100147275405" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a157775f6cae913f7923a3b57a414e22/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F1682082d-ea56-46ba-8142-3ea07486c857.jpg&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:69.43359375% 87.03976435935199%;" data-reactid="28"/></picture></div></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><!-- react-empty: 31 --><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="32"><h1 data-reactid="33"><span class="" data-reactid="34"><a href="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b4a26db6-de1a-4a20-bf3b-85d0dc61692f.jpg" class="font-title" data-reactid="35">Crowded Solitude</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 36 --><!-- react-empty: 37 --><div class="Paragraph color-text t-a-j" data-reactid="38"><p data-reactid="39">Whenever I travel, I like to look at people, talk to people, and be with people, even if I don’t know them.
